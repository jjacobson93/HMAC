A set of crypto libraries for Swift, written in Swift.
 
## HMAC
 
HMAC is a library that provides HMAC message authentication support on top of CryptoEssentials.

## Usage

```swift
var messageBytes = [UInt8](), passwordBytes = [UInt8]()
messageBytes.append(contentsOf: "MyMessage".utf8)
passwordBytes.append(contentsOf: "hunter2".utf8)

let passwordHash = SHA2<SHA512>.calculate(passwordBytes)
   
let authenticatedMessage = HMAC<MD5>.authenticate(message, withkey: passwordHash)
```
